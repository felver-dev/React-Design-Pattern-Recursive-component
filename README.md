# This is a Recursive Component Design Pattern in React 

A recursive component in React is a component that calls itself, either directly or indirectly, as part of its render logic. Recursive components are particularly useful when dealing with hierarchical data structures such as trees, menus, nested comments, or file directories.

Key Characteristics of Recursive Components
Base Case: A condition that stops the recursion to prevent infinite loops.
Recursive Case: A condition where the component renders itself for the nested part of the data.
